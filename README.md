# ArduinoMusicMAS
Arduino program designed for a multi-agent system implemented across several Arduino boards. The system uses the simple Asynchronous BackTracking (ABT) algorithm to distribute role assignments in a musical ensemble on-the-fly (here, soprano, bass, and percussion). When role assignments are complete, the boards use synth outputs to perform the chord progression from Pachelbel's canon.

Detailed project documentation is included. The original system was developed on LittleBits hardware (see http://littlebits.cc/). The library "pitches.h" was taken from the official Arduino tutorials hosted at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Tone.
